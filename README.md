# Flashbots

Flashbots is a research and development organization formed to mitigate the negative externalities posed by Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) to stateful blockchains, starting with Ethereum. 

## Our Work
Our primary focus is to enable a *permissionless*, *transparent*, and *sustainable* ecosystem for MEV, via a three-pronged approach: 

* **Illuminate**: Bringing transparency to MEV activity.
* **Democratize**: Democratizing access to MEV revenue.
* **Distribute**: Enabling sustainable distribution of MEV revenue.


## Our Dual Engines
Product & research are the semi-autonomous dual engines that propel our organization forward:
- [Flashbots Product](https://docs.flashbots.net/) builds core infrastructure and ecosystem tooling that redefine the block production supply chain across blockchains.
- [Flashbots Research](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-research) explores MEV market dynamics and blockchain design challenges at the intersection of economics, security, and cryptography.

Flashbots Research and Product are tightly-coupled dual engines that propel our organization forward in a phased approach:
* Long-term oriented research efforts spec out and update our roadmap, define our organization’s phases and identify key milestones.
* Milestone-oriented engineering efforts ship core infrastructure and ecosystem tools while collecting data and other artifacts that feed back into research.

Our work is open source and you can follow our progress in each respective repository of the Flashbots organization. Anyone is welcome to comment on an issue or pick it up entirely.

## Community

## Join us!
We are not your typical project, we are fully remote and our principles are based on that of a [pirate hacker collective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0fAznO1wA8). If you are a self-directed individual who puts collective success above your own and is motivated by solving challenging problems with asymmetric impact, you will fit right in.
