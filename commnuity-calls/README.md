# Flashbots Community Calls

A Community Call is a flash organization of humans and robots devoted to exploring, designing, and synthesizing various aspects of stateful blockchains. The goal of a working group is to produce high-quality, relevant technical and engineering documents that influence the way people design, use, and implement blockchain protocols. These documents include design space discussion recordings, protocol standards, best practices, and various informational documents. This process is loosely inspired by the mission of the [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/about/introduction/#mission) and the [Ethereum Project Management](https://github.com/ethereum/pm) process.
