# Flashbots Community Calls

A Community Call is a flash organization of humans and robots devoted to exploring, designing, and synthesizing various aspects of stateful blockchains. The primary goal of a community goal is to facilitate public design and informational discussions while producing relevant technical and engineering documents. These documents encompass design space discussion recordings, protocol standards, best practices, and a variety of informational materials. This process is loosely inspired by the mission of the [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/about/introduction/#mission) and the [Ethereum Project Management](https://github.com/ethereum/pm) process.
