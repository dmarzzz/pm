##  SUAVE.dev

SUAPP Developer Call aimed to spotlight recent developers and teach participants how to build SUAPPs, providing a comprehensive walkthrough of SUAPP development while discussing tradeoffs and design constraints. On the way we will also educate developers on SUAVE idioms and design patterns to build a common understanding, generate content and tutorials on SUAPP development, and demonstrate the process by building SUAPPs live on stream.
