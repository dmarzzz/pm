##  Flashwares
The long-term goal of Flashwares is to bolster an open source community centered around TEEs. This includes for example having better audits for SGX, having any audits for TDX, and hardening of open source solutions. We will start with a bi-weekly series of introductory but progressively more in-depth live sessions and blog posts on TEEs, starting with SGX and quickly moving towards TDX and our open problems
